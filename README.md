# Bad Reilly Discord Bot

Unfortunately, a dedicated voice channel where Reilly can't speak isn't enough. Let's solve that ðŸ˜ˆ

## Notes

- Uses discord.js NodeJS client (https://discord.js.org/)
- Requires the following env variables (can be stored off in a .env file):
  - BOT_TOKEN (the token from discord.com that let's you act as your both)
  - REILLY_ID (... Reilly's discord user id)
  - GUILD_ID (the id of the Discord server)
  - CHANNEL_ID (the id of the "shame" channel)
